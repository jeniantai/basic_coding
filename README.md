# Foundational Coding

This records my coding journey and things I want to keep notes to remind myself in the future projects.

Contents:
- data structure (linkedlist, queue, stack, hashmap)
- algorithm 
    - runtime & space
    - search algorithms such as linear, naive pattern search
    - sorting algorithms e.g. bubble sort, merge sort, quicksort
    - recursion e.g. factorial, fibonacci, flattening, binary search
