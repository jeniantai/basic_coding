# Foundational Coding

This records my coding journey and things I want to keep notes to remind myself in the future projects.

Contents:
- data structure (linkedlist, queue, stack, hashmap, trees)
- algorithm 
    - runtime & space
    - basic search algorithms such as linear, naive pattern search, BFS, DFS, binary search
    - recursion e.g. factorial, fibonacci, flattening
    - sorting algorithms e.g. bubble sort, merge sort, quicksort
    - dynamic programming & memorization
